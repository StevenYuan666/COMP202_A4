# Flu Pandemic Data Analysis
It’s the winter, and Montreal is having a flu pandemic (oh no!). It’s not going well and somehow now you’re the one in charge of getting data on the pandemic to the epidemiologists.

Given one large file of raw data about the early days of the pandemic. But the data was recorded by dozens of different people and systems. In the chaos of the pandemic, data was not recorded in consistent ways. Some lines are recorded in French. Others in English. Some lines separate the information with tabs, others with commas.

“Data cleaning” refers to the process of taking raw data and processing it into a state that can be used for empirical analysis. The task here is to clean the raw data file which are given.

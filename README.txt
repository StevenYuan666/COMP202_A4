For the Assignment 4, I shared my thoughts and logics with about 3 to 4 people. However, since the raw file for everybody is different, we did not talked about anything about the code. Additionally, for the time series graph, the initial colours of my graph are different with the graph given in the assignment, so I changed another three colours. I hope it's okay to do so.

Nothing more to say, thank you for grading my work.
